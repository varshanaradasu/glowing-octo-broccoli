# What is Python 2?
Python 2.0 was introduced to the tech world in the year 2000. Created by the BeOpen Python Labs team, the purpose of the introduction of Python 2 was to make programming simple and easy to learn for the common masses.
Python 2 was successful in implementing the technical details of the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP). However, after the introduction of Python 3, Python 2 could not find a lot of its usage in the tech world and the year 2020 marked the end of Python 2’s legacy with Python 2.7 being its latest version. 
### Given below is a timeline of the release of the various versions of the Python 2.X series:
* Python 2.0 – October 16, 2000
* Python 2.1 – April 17, 2001
* Python 2.2 – December 21, 2001
* Python 2.3 – July 29, 2003
* Python 2.4 – November 30, 2004
* Python 2.5 – September 19, 2006
* Python 2.6 – October 1, 2008
* Python 2.7-July 3, 2010

# What is Python 3?
Released in the year 2008, Python 3 was not just another version of Python 2 after debugging. The introduction of Python was mostly surrounded by the motive that redundancy – writing repetitive code or writing the same piece of code again and again – should be removed from coding. Python 3 is backwards incompatible and aims at eliminating the problems which new programmers face while learning a programming language.
### Given below is a timeline of the release of the various versions of the Python 3.X series:
* Python 3.0 – December 3, 2008
* Python 3.1 – June 27, 2009
* Python 3.2 – February 20, 2011
* Python 3.3 – September 29, 2012
* Python 3.4-March 16, 2014
* Python 3.5 – September 13, 2015
* Python 3.6- October 2016
* Python 3.7- June 2018.

## Python 2 vs. Python 3 Example Code
# Python 2
def main():
  print "Hi! This is Python 2"
  
if __name__== "__main__":
  main()

# Python 3
def main():
  print ("Hi! This is Python 3")
  
if __name__== "__main__":
  main()

# Conclusion
So, in conclusion, we would like to say that Python is one of the most in-demand languages in today’s times as it is being heavily used in a large number of fields. Promising fields of the future like Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, etc. have seemed to heavily rely on Python and its libraries and frameworks like Numpy, Pandas, etc.

Hence, if any budding programmer today wants to start his or her coding career, learning Python might be a great choice for him or her. Also, through this article, we wish to clear out the differences between the two major versions of Python – Python 2 and Python 3 and establish why Python 3 is the version for the future.
