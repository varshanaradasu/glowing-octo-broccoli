>Python 2.x is an older major version of the Python programming language.

>Python 3.x is the current, modern, and actively developed version of the Python programming language.


1. Print Statement:

Python 2: print "Hello"

Python 3: print("Hello")
→ Print is a function in Python 3.

2. Integer Division:

Python 2: 5/2 = 2

Python 3: 5/2 = 2.5
→ Python 3 performs true division by default.

3. Unicode Support:

Python 2: Strings are ASCII by default.

Python 3: Strings are Unicode by default.

4. xrange() vs range():

Python 2: xrange() for iteration, range() returns a list.

Python 3: range() behaves like xrange() (efficient iterator).

5. Error Handling Syntax:

Python 2: except Exception, e:

Python 3: except Exception as e:

6. Input Function:

Python 2: raw_input()

Python 3: input()
(Python 2’s input() is removed)

7. Library Support:

Python 2 is no longer supported (EOL in 2020).

Python 3 gets all new features and updates.

8. Iteration Differences:

Many functions return iterators in Python 3
(e.g., dict.keys(), dict.values()).

9. Better Syntax & Features in Python 3:

Python 3 includes:

f-strings

type annotations

asyncio

improved standard library

10. Community Adoption:

Python 2 is outdated.

Python 3 is the standard for all development.

11. Performance:

Python 3 has better performance in:

memory handling

concurrency (via asyncio)

built-in optimizations
