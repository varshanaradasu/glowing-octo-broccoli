## 1. JavaScript is Single-Threaded
JavaScript executes one piece of code at a time using a single main thread.

## 2. Synchronous Code Runs in the Call Stack
All regular code—like variable assignments and function calls—executes immediately inside the call stack.

## 3. Web APIs Enable Asynchronous Behavior
Functions such as `setTimeout`, `fetch`, and DOM event listeners run outside the call stack through Web APIs.

## 4. Async Callbacks Don’t Enter the Call Stack Directly
Once Web APIs finish their task, the callback is placed into a queue rather than running immediately.

## 5. Two Types of Queues: Microtask & Macrotask
- **Microtask Queue:** Promise callbacks, `queueMicrotask`
- **Macrotask Queue:** `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, DOM event callbacks

## 6. Microtasks Run Before Macrotasks
When the call stack becomes empty, **all** microtasks execute before any macrotask.

## 7. Event Loop Controls Execution Order
The event loop checks:
- If the call stack is empty  
- Whether microtasks need to run  
- When to move to the next macrotask

## 8. `setTimeout(..., 0)` Does Not Run Immediately
Even with zero delay, the callback waits behind microtasks and any previous queued tasks.

## 9. Promises Run Before Timeouts
Promise resolutions are microtasks, so their callbacks run before macrotask operations such as `setTimeout`.

## 10. Understanding the Event Loop Improves Real-World Coding
It helps avoid UI freezes, reduces bugs in async code, and makes behavior predictable—important for both development and interviews.
