# Framework vs Library

## What is a Library?

A **library** is a collection of reusable functions or components that you **call whenever you need them**.

* You are in control of the application flow
* You decide **when and where** to use the library
* It provides specific functionality

### Example of Libraries

* jQuery
* React (often called a library)
* NumPy

---

## What is a Framework?

A **framework** is a complete structure that **controls the flow of the application**. You build your code **inside the framework’s rules and structure**.

* The framework is in control (Inversion of Control)
* It provides a **predefined structure**
* You must follow its conventions

### Example of Frameworks

* Angular
* Django
* Bootstrap

 A framework is like a **house blueprint**. You design your rooms, but the structure is already fixed.

Bootstrap is considered a **front-end framework** because it provides a **complete system for building responsive websites**.

## Reasons Why Bootstrap is a Framework

### 1. Predefined Structure

Bootstrap provides:
