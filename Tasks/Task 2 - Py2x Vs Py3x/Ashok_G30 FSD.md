# What is Python 2
Python was developed in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum and made public for the first time in 1991. After nine years of development and increased popularity, Python 2.0 was released in 2000. 
Python 2 came with a brand new technical specification called Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP), which aimed at providing guidelines and best practices for writing Python code. It also comes with new features, such as list comprehension, Unicode support, and a cycle-detecting garbage collector.
But the most important change in Python 2 was to the development process itself. Python was conceived as a programming language that is easy to learn for beginners. To achieve this goal, the team responsible for developing Python –with Guido ban Rossum on top–decided to shift to a more transparent and community-backed development process.
Python 2 continued to develop over time. Successive versions added new functionality to the programming language. The last version of Python 2, released in 2010, was Python 2.7. The support for this version ended on January 1, 2020.
# What is Python 3
Python 3 is the next generation of the programming language. It was released in December 2008, along with several improvements and new features. 
Python 3 was not just another version of Python 2 code after debugging. The new version drastically changed the language to address security issues and design flaws in previous versions. Python 3 came with a new syntax intended to prevent redundant or repetitive code, that is, code that does the same task in different ways. By providing a single, clear way of doing things, the ease of use and readability of Python 3 has improved considerably.  
Some of the major changes in Python 3 include changing the print declaration to a built-in function, improved integer division, and improved Unicode support. The nature of these changes is such that Python 3 was incompatible with Python 2, in other words, it is backwards incompatible.
