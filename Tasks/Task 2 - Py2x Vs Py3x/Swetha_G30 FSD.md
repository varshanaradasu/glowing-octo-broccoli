Python 2 vs Python 3 
Python 2 is old, Python 3 is the current version
Python 2 isn't updated anymore. Python 3 is what everyone uses now for
new code. Differences with Examples 1. Printing :

Python 2:

print "Hello"

Python 3:

print("Hello")

2\. Text (strings): Python 2 treats text as bytes:

s = "hello" print type(s) # <type 'str'>

Python 3 treats text as Unicode:

s = "hello" print(type(s))

Python 3 can handle emojis also

3. Division :

Python 2 does integer division by default:

print 3 / 2 # output: 1

Python 3 gives real division:

print(3 / 2) # output: 1.5

To get integer division in Python 3:

print(3 // 2) # output: 1

4\. Libraries :

Modern libraries often drop Python 2 support. For example, something
like this might work only in Python 3:

import requests

finally , Python 2 = old, retired Python 3 = newer, better, easier, and
widely used
