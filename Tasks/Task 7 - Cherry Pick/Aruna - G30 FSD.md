After learning about Git cherry-pick, I understood that it is a Git command used to take a specific commit from one branch and apply it to another branch. Instead of merging the whole branch, cherry-pick helps in selecting only the required change, which keeps the project clean.

Cherry-pick is mainly useful in situations like:

merge conflict test!!!

Moving a single feature commit

Recovering work committed to the wrong branch

I learned that every commit in Git has a unique commit ID called a SHA. Cherry-pick uses this commit ID to copy the changes and apply them to another branch. When a commit is cherry-picked, Git creates a new commit in the target branch, so the commit ID will be different even though the changes are the same.

The basic steps I understood to use cherry-pick are:

Check commits using git log

Switch to the required branch using git checkout

Apply the commit using git cherry-pick <commit-id>

Sometimes conflicts may occur during cherry-picking if the same code is modified in both branches. In such cases, the conflicts need to be resolved manually. After fixing them, the changes are added and the cherry-pick process is continued. If required, the process can also be aborted.

I also learned that Git allows cherry-picking multiple commits or a range of commits when needed. It is best to cherry-pick small and independent commits and avoid cherry-picking merge commits.

Another important concept I understood is about author and committer. The author is the person who originally wrote the code, and the committer is the person who applies the commit. During cherry-pick, the original author remains the same, but the person who performs cherry-pick becomes the committer. This helps in maintaining proper credit.

So, from my understanding, git cherry-pick is a simple and powerful command that helps in selectively applying changes between branches while keeping the project history clean.
